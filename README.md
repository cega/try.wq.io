# Try WQ!

This is the source code for [Try WQ], the "kitchen sync" demo for the [wq Framework] as well as the [vera] data model.  If you are new to wq, you can visit the [Try WQ] site online to experiment with it and see how everything works together.

If you are implementing your own wq-powered site for the first time, we recommend starting from the [wq start] template or from [Species Tracker], rather than from the Try WQ codebase.  Both of those templates use a much simpler data model than what Try WQ provides.

On the other hand, if you are interested in building your own "form-builder" or "campaign" based site with an [ERAV]-powered database structure, the source code here (and for [vera](https://github.com/wq/vera)) may be helpful as a starting point.
