# Try WQ!

This is the source code for [Try WQ], the "kitchen sync" demo for the [wq Framework] as well as the [vera] data model.  If you are new to wq, you can visit the [Try WQ] site online to experiment with it and see how everything works together.

If you are implementing your own wq-powered site, you will want to start by [determining which data model to use][data model].  If you are using wq for the first time, we recommend using a simple relational model like that provided by the [wq start] template and [Species Tracker], rather the relatively complex [ERAV] model utilized by Try WQ.

On the other hand, if you are interested in building your own "form-builder" or "campaign" based site with an [ERAV]-powered database structure, the source code here (and for [vera](https://github.com/wq/vera)) should be helpful as a starting point.
